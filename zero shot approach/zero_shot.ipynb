      "Abstract: implantation of cardiovascular stents is an important therapeutic method to treat coronary artery diseases. baremetal and drugeluting stents show promising clinical outcomes, however, their permanent presence may create complications. in recent years, numerous preclinical and clinical trials have evaluated the properties of bioresorbable stents, including polymer and magnesiumbased stents. threedimensional 3d printedshapememory polymeric materials enable the selfdeployment of stents and provide a novel approach for individualized treatment. novel bioresorbable metallic stents such as iron and zincbased stents have also been investigated and refined. however, the development of novel bioresorbable stents accompanied by clinical translation remains timeconsuming and challenging. this review comprehensively summarizes the development of bioresorbable stents based on their preclinicalclinical trials and highlights translational research as well as novel technologies for stents e.g., bioresorbable electronic stents integrated with biosensors. these findings are expected to inspire the design of novel stents and optimization approaches to improve the efficacy of treatments for cardiovascular diseases.\n",

      "Abstract: abstract for over three earth years the marsquake service has been analyzing the data sent back from the seismic experiment for interior structurethe seismometer placed on the surface of mars by nasas insight lander. although by october 2021, the mars seismic catalog included 951 events, until recently all these events have been assessed as lying within a radius of 100 of insight. here we report two distant events that occurred within days of each other, located on the far side of mars, giving us our first glimpse into mars core shadow zone. the first event, recorded on 25 august 2021 insight sol 976, shows clear polarized arrivals that we interpret to be pp and ss phases at low frequencies and locates to valles marineris, 146 7 from insight. the second event, occurring on 18 september 2021 sol 1000, has significantly more broadband energy with emergent pp and ss arrivals, and a weak phase arriving before pp that we interpret as pdiff. considering uncertain pick times and poorly constrained travel times for pdiff, we estimate this event is at a distance between 107 and 147 from insight. with magnitudes of mwma 4.2 and 4.1, respectively, these are the largest seismic events recorded so far on mars.\n",

      "Abstract: we present a nearly complete rapid neutroncapture process rprocess chemical inventory of the metalpoor feh 1.46 0.10 rprocessenhanced eufe 1.32 0.08 halo star hd 222925. this abundance set is the most complete for any object beyond the solar system, with a total of 63 metals detected and seven with upper limits. it comprises 42 elements from 31 z 90, including elements rarely detected in rprocessenhanced stars, such as ga, ge, as, se, cd, in, sn, sb, te, w, re, os, ir, pt, and au. we derive these abundances from an analysis of 404 absorption lines in ultraviolet spectra collected using the space telescope imaging spectrograph on the hubble space telescope and previously analyzed optical spectra. a series of appendices discusses the atomic data and quality of fits for these lines. the rprocess elements from ba to pb, including all elements at the third rprocess peak, exhibit remarkable agreement with the solar rprocess residuals, with a standard deviation of the differences of only 0.08 dex 17. in contrast, deviations among the lighter elements from ga to te span nearly 1.4 dex, and they show distinct trends from ga to se, nb through cd, and in through te. the rprocess contribution to ga, ge, and as is small, and se is the lightest element whose production is dominated by the rprocess. the lanthanide fraction, log x la 1.39 0.09, is typical for rprocessenhanced stars and higher than that of the kilonova from the gw170817 neutronstar merger event. we advocate adopting this pattern as an alternative to the solar rprocesselement residuals when confronting future theoretical models of heavyelement nucleosynthesis with observations.\n",

      "Abstract: building sufficient recycled water infrastructure is an effective way to solve problems related to water shortages and environmental degradation, and is of great strategic significance for saving resources, protecting the ecological environment, and promoting sustainable social and economic development. although recycled water is environmentally friendly, the public is still skeptical about its use, which has led to the failure of a large number of recycled water infrastructure investments therefore, increasing the publics willingness to reuse is critical for the construction of recycled water infrastructure. to identify the influence mechanism of user comments on public reuse behaviors, we conducted an eyetracking experiment in china. the results demonstrated that 1 perceived usefulness, perceived quality, and perceived risk have significant impacts on the publics willingness to buy 2 user reviews can enhance the publics perceived usefulness of recycled products and increase their willingness to buy and 3 in the process of consumption, the public tends to pay attention to negative reviews, where user reviews alter the perceived risks and perceived prices of recycled products, thereby affecting the willingness to buy of consumers. this study provides a scientific reference for the construction of recycled water infrastructure and the further promotion of recycled water.\n",
