gemma,is coding a relevant metaphor for the brain,"neural coding is a popular metaphor in neuroscience, where objective properties of the world are communicated to the brain in the form of spikes. here i argue that this metaphor is often inappropriate and misleading. first, when neurons are said to encode experimental parameters, the neural code depends on experimental details that are not carried by the coding variable e.g., the spike count. thus, the representational power of neural codes is much more limited than generally implied. second, neural codes carry information only by reference to things with known meaning. in contrast, perceptual systems must build information from relations between sensory signals and actions, forming an internal model. neural codes are inadequate for this purpose because they are unstructured and therefore unable to represent relations. third, coding variables are observables tied to the temporality of experiments, whereas spikes are timed actions that mediate coupling in a distributed dynamical system. the coding metaphor tries to fit the dynamic, circular, and distributed causal structure of the brain into a linear chain of transformations between observables, but the two causal structures are incongruent. i conclude that the neural coding metaphor cannot provide a valid basis for theories of brain function, because it is incompatible with both the causal structure of the brain and the representational requirements of cognition.",Psychology,"['Title', 'Abstract']",0.604,0.35,34.76,14.31,2018

gemma,tilting uranus via the migration of an ancient satellite,"context. the 98 obliquity of uranus is commonly attributed to giant impacts that occurred at the end of the planetary formation. this picture, however, is not devoid of weaknesses. aims. on a billionyear timescale, the tidal migration of the satellites of jupiter and saturn has been shown to strongly affect their spinaxis dynamics. we aim to revisit the scenario of tilting uranus in light of this mechanism. methods. we analyse the precession spectrum of uranus and identify the candidate secular spinorbit resonances that could be responsible for the tilting. we determine the properties of the hypothetical ancient satellite required for a capture and explore the dynamics numerically. results. if it migrates over 10 uranuss radii, a single satellite with minimum mass 4 10 4 uranuss mass is able to tilt uranus from a small obliquity and make it converge towards 90. in order to achieve the tilting in less than the age of the solar system, the mean drift rate of the satellite must be comparable to the moons current orbital expansion. under these conditions, simulations show that uranus is readily tilted over 80. beyond this point, the satellite is strongly destabilised and triggers a phase of chaotic motion for the planets spin axis. the chaotic phase ends when the satellite collides into the planet, ultimately freezing the planets obliquity in either a prograde or a plainly retrograde state as uranus today. spin states resembling that of uranus can be obtained with probabilities as large as 80, but a bigger satellite is favoured, with mass 1.7 10 3 uranuss mass or more. yet, a smaller ancient satellite is not categorically ruled out, and we discuss several ways to improve this basic scenario in future studies. interactions among several preexisting satellites are a promising possibility. conclusions. the conditions required for the tilting seem broadly realistic, but it remains to be determined whether uranus could have hosted a big primordial satellite subject to substantial tidal migration. the efficiency of tidal energy dissipation within uranus is required to be much higher than traditionally assumed, more in line with that measured for the migration of titan. hints about these issues would be given by a measure of the expansion rate of uranuss main satellites.",Physical Science,"['Title', 'Abstract']",0.418,0.75,50.57,13,2022

gemma,dynamics of a twolayer neuronal network with asymmetry in coupling,"investigating the effect of changes in neuronal connectivity on the brains behavior is of interest in neuroscience studies. complex network theory is one of the most capable tools to study the effects of these changes on collective brain behavior. by using complex networks, the neural structure, function, and dynamics can be analyzed. in this context, various frameworks can be used to mimic neural networks, among which multilayer networks are a proper one. compared to singlelayer models, multilayer networks can provide a more realistic model of the brain due to their high complexity and dimensionality. this paper examines the effect of changes in asymmetry coupling on the behaviors of a multilayer neuronal network. to this aim, a twolayer network is considered as a minimum model of left and right cerebral hemispheres communicated with the corpus callosum. the chaotic model of hindmarshrose is taken as the dynamics of the nodes. only two neurons of each layer connect two layers of the network. in this model, it is assumed that the layers have different coupling strengths, so the effect of each coupling change on network behavior can be analyzed. as a result, the projection of the nodes is plotted for several coupling strengths to investigate how the asymmetry coupling influences the network behaviors. it is observed that although no coexisting attractor is present in the hindmarshrose model, an asymmetry in couplings causes the emergence of different attractors. the bifurcation diagrams of one node of each layer are presented to show the variation of the dynamics due to coupling changes. for further analysis, the network synchronization is investigated by computing intralayer and interlayer errors. calculating these errors shows that the network can be synchronized only for large enough symmetric coupling.",Mathematics,"['Title', 'Abstract']",0.144,0.75,43.63,12.95,2022
gemma,"the qplus sensor, a powerful core for the atomic force microscope","atomic force microscopy afm was introduced in 1986 and has since made its way into surface science, nanoscience, chemistry, biology, and material science as an imaging and manipulating tool with a rising number of applications. afm can be employed in ambient and liquid environments as well as in vacuum and at low and ultralow temperatures. the technique is an offspring of scanning tunneling microscopy stm, where the tunneling tip of the stm is replaced by using a force sensor with an attached tip. measuring the tiny chemical forces that act between the tip and the sample is more difficult than measuring the tunneling current in stm. therefore, even 30 years after the introduction of afm, progress in instrumentation is substantial. here, we focus on the core of the afm, the force sensor with its tip and detection mechanism. initially, force sensors were mainly micromachined silicon cantilevers, mainly using optical methods to detect their deflection. the qplus sensor, originally based on a quartz tuning fork and now custom built from quartz, is selfsensing by utilizing the piezoelectricity of quartz. the qplus sensor allows us to perform stm and afm in parallel, and the spatial resolution of its afm channel has reached the subatomic level, exceeding the resolution of stm. frequency modulation afm fmafm, where the frequency of an oscillating cantilever is altered by the gradient of the force that acts between the tip and the sample, has emerged over the years as the method that provides atomic and subatomic spatial resolution as well as force spectroscopy with subpiconewton sensitivity. fmafm is precise because of all physical observables, time and frequency can be measured by far with the greatest accuracy. by design, fmafm clearly separates conservative and dissipative interactions where conservative forces induce a frequency shift and dissipative interactions alter the power needed to maintain a constant oscillation amplitude of the cantilever. as it operates in a noncontact mode, it enables simultaneous afm and stm measurements. the frequency stability of quartz and the small oscillation amplitudes that are possible with stiff quartz sensors optimize the signal to noise ratio. here, we discuss the operating principles, the assembly of qplus sensors, amplifiers, limiting factors, and applications. applications encompass unprecedented subatomic spatial resolution, the measurement of forces that act in atomic manipulation, imaging and spectroscopy of spindependent forces, and atomic resolution of organic molecules, graphite, graphene, and oxides.",Computer Science,"['Title', 'Abstract']",0.633,0.85,38.05,16.24,2019

gemma,tilting uranus via the migration of an ancient satellite,"context. the 98 obliquity of uranus is commonly attributed to giant impacts that occurred at the end of the planetary formation. this picture, however, is not devoid of weaknesses. aims. on a billionyear timescale, the tidal migration of the satellites of jupiter and saturn has been shown to strongly affect their spinaxis dynamics. we aim to revisit the scenario of tilting uranus in light of this mechanism. methods. we analyse the precession spectrum of uranus and identify the candidate secular spinorbit resonances that could be responsible for the tilting. we determine the properties of the hypothetical ancient satellite required for a capture and explore the dynamics numerically. results. if it migrates over 10 uranuss radii, a single satellite with minimum mass 4 10 4 uranuss mass is able to tilt uranus from a small obliquity and make it converge towards 90. in order to achieve the tilting in less than the age of the solar system, the mean drift rate of the satellite must be comparable to the moons current orbital expansion. under these conditions, simulations show that uranus is readily tilted over 80. beyond this point, the satellite is strongly destabilised and triggers a phase of chaotic motion for the planets spin axis. the chaotic phase ends when the satellite collides into the planet, ultimately freezing the planets obliquity in either a prograde or a plainly retrograde state as uranus today. spin states resembling that of uranus can be obtained with probabilities as large as 80, but a bigger satellite is favoured, with mass 1.7 10 3 uranuss mass or more. yet, a smaller ancient satellite is not categorically ruled out, and we discuss several ways to improve this basic scenario in future studies. interactions among several preexisting satellites are a promising possibility. conclusions. the conditions required for the tilting seem broadly realistic, but it remains to be determined whether uranus could have hosted a big primordial satellite subject to substantial tidal migration. the efficiency of tidal energy dissipation within uranus is required to be much higher than traditionally assumed, more in line with that measured for the migration of titan. hints about these issues would be given by a measure of the expansion rate of uranuss main satellites.",Physical Science,"['Title', 'Abstract', 'Flesch Reading Ease', 'Gunning Fog Index']",0.418,0.75,50.57,13,2022

gemma,panning for gold modelx knockoffs for high dimensional controlled variable selection,"summary many contemporary largescale applications involve building interpretable models linking a large set of potential covariates to a response in a nonlinear fashion, such as when the response is binary. although this modelling problem has been extensively studied, it remains unclear how to control the fraction of false discoveries effectively even in high dimensional logistic regression, not to mention general high dimensional nonlinear models. to address such a practical problem, we propose a new framework of modelx knockoffs, which reads from a different perspective the knockoff procedure that was originally designed for controlling the false discovery rate in linear models. whereas the knockoffs procedure is constrained to homoscedastic linear models with np, the key innovation here is that modelx knockoffs provide valid inference from finite samples in settings in which the conditional distribution of the response is arbitrary and completely unknown. furthermore, this holds no matter the number of covariates. correct inference in such a broad setting is achieved by constructing knockoff variables probabilistically instead of geometrically. to do this, our approach requires that the covariates are random independent and identically distributed rows with a distribution that is known, although we provide preliminary experimental evidence that our procedure is robust to unknown or estimated distributions. to our knowledge, no other procedure solves the controlled variable selection problem in such generality but, in the restricted settings where competitors exist, we demonstrate the superior power of knockoffs through simulations. finally, we apply our procedure to data from a casecontrol study of crohns disease in the uk, making twice as many discoveries as the original analysis of the same data.",Mathematics,"['Title', 'Abstract', 'Flesch Reading Ease', 'Gunning Fog Index']",0.984,0.75,24.41,18.92,2018

gemma,dynamics of a twolayer neuronal network with asymmetry in coupling,"investigating the effect of changes in neuronal connectivity on the brains behavior is of interest in neuroscience studies. complex network theory is one of the most capable tools to study the effects of these changes on collective brain behavior. by using complex networks, the neural structure, function, and dynamics can be analyzed. in this context, various frameworks can be used to mimic neural networks, among which multilayer networks are a proper one. compared to singlelayer models, multilayer networks can provide a more realistic model of the brain due to their high complexity and dimensionality. this paper examines the effect of changes in asymmetry coupling on the behaviors of a multilayer neuronal network. to this aim, a twolayer network is considered as a minimum model of left and right cerebral hemispheres communicated with the corpus callosum. the chaotic model of hindmarshrose is taken as the dynamics of the nodes. only two neurons of each layer connect two layers of the network. in this model, it is assumed that the layers have different coupling strengths, so the effect of each coupling change on network behavior can be analyzed. as a result, the projection of the nodes is plotted for several coupling strengths to investigate how the asymmetry coupling influences the network behaviors. it is observed that although no coexisting attractor is present in the hindmarshrose model, an asymmetry in couplings causes the emergence of different attractors. the bifurcation diagrams of one node of each layer are presented to show the variation of the dynamics due to coupling changes. for further analysis, the network synchronization is investigated by computing intralayer and interlayer errors. calculating these errors shows that the network can be synchronized only for large enough symmetric coupling.",Mathematics,"['Title', 'Abstract', 'Flesch Reading Ease', 'Gunning Fog Index']",0.144,0.75,43.63,12.95,2022
gemma,"the qplus sensor, a powerful core for the atomic force microscope","atomic force microscopy afm was introduced in 1986 and has since made its way into surface science, nanoscience, chemistry, biology, and material science as an imaging and manipulating tool with a rising number of applications. afm can be employed in ambient and liquid environments as well as in vacuum and at low and ultralow temperatures. the technique is an offspring of scanning tunneling microscopy stm, where the tunneling tip of the stm is replaced by using a force sensor with an attached tip. measuring the tiny chemical forces that act between the tip and the sample is more difficult than measuring the tunneling current in stm. therefore, even 30 years after the introduction of afm, progress in instrumentation is substantial. here, we focus on the core of the afm, the force sensor with its tip and detection mechanism. initially, force sensors were mainly micromachined silicon cantilevers, mainly using optical methods to detect their deflection. the qplus sensor, originally based on a quartz tuning fork and now custom built from quartz, is selfsensing by utilizing the piezoelectricity of quartz. the qplus sensor allows us to perform stm and afm in parallel, and the spatial resolution of its afm channel has reached the subatomic level, exceeding the resolution of stm. frequency modulation afm fmafm, where the frequency of an oscillating cantilever is altered by the gradient of the force that acts between the tip and the sample, has emerged over the years as the method that provides atomic and subatomic spatial resolution as well as force spectroscopy with subpiconewton sensitivity. fmafm is precise because of all physical observables, time and frequency can be measured by far with the greatest accuracy. by design, fmafm clearly separates conservative and dissipative interactions where conservative forces induce a frequency shift and dissipative interactions alter the power needed to maintain a constant oscillation amplitude of the cantilever. as it operates in a noncontact mode, it enables simultaneous afm and stm measurements. the frequency stability of quartz and the small oscillation amplitudes that are possible with stiff quartz sensors optimize the signal to noise ratio. here, we discuss the operating principles, the assembly of qplus sensors, amplifiers, limiting factors, and applications. applications encompass unprecedented subatomic spatial resolution, the measurement of forces that act in atomic manipulation, imaging and spectroscopy of spindependent forces, and atomic resolution of organic molecules, graphite, graphene, and oxides.",Computer Science,"['Title', 'Abstract', 'Flesch Reading Ease', 'Gunning Fog Index']",0.633,0.85,38.05,16.24,2019
